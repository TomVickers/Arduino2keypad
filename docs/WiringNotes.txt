Notes on Wiring diagrams

Arduino_Keypad_Wiring.jpg
This image is very similar to a drawing posted on Mark Kimsal's site.  My components are sized for the
5 volt signaling used by the Arduino Mega.  I also added a 1k pull down resistor on the transmit line
to the keypad (my circuit would not work without it).

Alarm_Power_Wiring.jpg
This image documents the circuit I am using to power my alarm project.  I am using a Dell laptop power
brick (19v output) and a couple of large diodes (to drop the voltage a bit) to drive a picoUPS-100 module.  
The picoUPS will trickle charge a connected 12v gell cell battery and continue to provide DC output if 
the primary power is removed.  The output of the picoUPS drives a DC-DC converter set for 5 volt output.  
This will power the Raspberry PI as well as the connected Arduino.  I plan to monitor the input and output 
power of the picoUPS as well as the battery voltage via analog inputs on the Arduino.  This should allow 
for a clean shutdown of the Raspberry PI if I detect that the input power is off and the battery voltage 
is getting low.
