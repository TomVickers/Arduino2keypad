# Arduino2keypad
Code to interface a 6160 alarm keypad with an Arduino.  If you are interested in using a 6160 alarm keypad (commonly found connected to a variety of Honeywell alarm systems like the Vista-20p), this code may be useful to you.

As with most things in life, my work on this is simply an extension of the work by others.  I found Mark Kimsal's website (http://getatanc.com/) and github repository (https://github.com/TANC-security/keypad-firmware) very helpful.  Most of what you will find here, I found first on his pages.  I have extended it a bit, and worked out some details of communicating directly with the keypad (his task involved talking to the alarm as a keypad).

--------------- NOTE: Very Beta non-functional code ------------------------

Not ready for prime time yet, uploading a work in progress.  This note will be removed once this closer to something usable.
